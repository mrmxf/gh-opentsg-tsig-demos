# tsig demos

A demo repo for making 3d displays in the
[obj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) and
[TSIG](https://link.to.tsig) formats.

Available display shapes are

- An open cube (No front wall panel)
- A curved cylindrical wall
- Spherical  display

## Getting started

Talk about OpenTSG and TSIGs here

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed.

Then run the go build command to compile the code.

```cmd
go build
```

## Running the program

Here's a list of
the demos for the 
different shaped objects

- [Cube](#cube-demo)
- [Curve](#curve-demo)
- [Sphere](#sphere-demo)

Once a demo has been run plug it into openTSG

### Cube Demo

## Golden ratios

Any numbers that seem to work really well.
e.g. Dx* tile width / radius must = 5
