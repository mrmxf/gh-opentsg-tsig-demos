# tsig demos

A commad line tool for generating 3d displays in the
[obj][o1] and [TSIG][t2] formats.

Available display shapes are

- An open cube (No front wall panel)
- A curved cylindrical wall
- A Spherical display

## Getting started

Make sure you are familiar with [OpenTSG][t1] and what
[TSIGs][t2] are and how they are used.

In short TSIGs allow you to generate test patterns for 3d displays,
with pixel accurate mapping. These TSIGs are used as
an input for OpenTSG, which generates the test signal.

Please note every obj file produced has tha z axis
as the vertical axis, so when importing the obj
into your software of choice you can get the
object the right way up.

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of Go from the
[official golang source][g1] installed.

Then run the go build command to compile the code.

```cmd
go build
```

## commands

The default command `gen` generates both the obj and TSIG
files.

The `obj` command ensures only an obj file is written.

The `tsig` command ensures only a TSIG tile is written.

The `list` command list the available shapes and their shape names

## flags

### Generate flags

These flags work for every obj and TSIG generating command

The `--conf` flag tells the cli which input yaml (or json) to parse.

The `--outputFile` tells the name of the file(s) to be saved,
the input string is without the inclusion of the file extension.
e.g.  `--outputFile ./examples/example` will produce two files,
`./examples/example.obj` and `./examples/example.json`

### list flags

To be added

## Demos

Ensure the command line is installed and running with
`./generator --help`
The name of the program may change based on your operating system.

Then you can run the first demo, which will generate a cube obj and
TSIG. This will make 2 separate files, of one obj and
one json TSIG file. Run the following command

```cmd
./generator --conf ./examples/cube.yaml --outputFile ./examples/cube
```

Now to find the output at the `./examples` folder
you will have generated `./examples/cube.obj`
and `./examples/cube.json`. Congratulations on
making your first TSIG!

### Obj only Demo

If you just want to make the obj then you can specify that with the `obj`
command. Run the following code below to just make the cube obj.

```cmd
./generator obj --conf ./examples/cube.yaml --outputFile ./examples/ObjOnly
```

If you check the `./examples` folder you will have generated
`./examples/ObjOnly.obj`, there is no TSIG in sight.

### TSIG Only Demo

If you just want to make the TSIG then you can specify that with the `tsig`
flag. Run the following code below to just make the cube TSIG.

```cmd
./generator tsig --conf ./examples/cube.yaml --outputFile ./examples/tsigOnly
```

If you check the `./examples` folder you will have generated
`./examples/tsigOnly.json`, there is no obj in sight.

### Available shapes

The following list of shapes will take you through
the config file for that shape. The config files can
be in json or yaml, the field names will be the same
for both file types.

- [Cube][cbd]
- [Curve][cvd]
- [Sphere][spd]

Once a demo has been run, the TSIG output can be
plugged into openTSG.

### Cube Demo

This demo will walk you through generating a cube shape display,
with a missing front panel. There is no option to add the front
panel in.

The cube demo is run with an input file of `./examples/cube.yaml`
which looks like.

```yaml
# The file type identifier
shape: cube
# tile dimensions
tileHeight: 0.5
tileWidth: 0.5
# cube dimensions
# X dimensions
cubeWidth: 5
# Z dimensions
cubeHeight: 5
# Y dimension
cubeDepth: 2.5
# Pixels per tile
# dx matches the tile width
dx: 500
# dy matches the tile height
dy: 500
```

Every field is required

Run the following to generate the cube TSIG and obj files.

```cmd
./generator --conf ./examples/cube.yaml --outputFile ./examples/cube
```

The generated files will be in `./examples`
as `./examples/cube.obj` and `./examples/cube.json`.
Plug the obj into an obj visualiser and see how it looks.
Then try using  the TSIG with openTSG to generate a
pattern of your choosing.

Feel free to change any of the values in the file
and run it again, try changing the depth to make
the cube really shallow.

### Curve Demo

This demo will walk you through generating a curved wall display.

The curve demo is run with an input file of `./examples/curve.yaml`
which looks like.`

```yaml
# The file type identifier
shape: curve
# tile dimensions
tileHeight: 0.5
tileWidth: 0.5
# cylinder dimensions
cylinderRadius: 5
cylinderHeight: 5
# Max angle in radians
# will be 30 degrees either side of the azimuth
# in this example.
azimuthMaxAngle: 0.5235987755982988
# Pixels per tile
dx: 500
dy: 500

```

Every field is required

Run the following to generate the curve obj and TSIG files.

```cmd
./generator --conf ./examples/curve.yaml --outputFile ./examples/curve
```

The generated files will be in `./examples`
as `./examples/curve.obj` and `./examples/curve.json`.
Plug the obj into an obj visualiser and see how it looks.
Then try using  the TSIG with openTSG to generate a
pattern of your choosing.

Feel free to change any of the values in the file
and run it again, change the angle and see how the uv map changes.

### Spherecap Demo

This demo will walk you through generating a spherecap wall display.

The spherecap demo is run with an input file of `./examples/SphereCap.yaml`
which looks like.

```yaml
# The file type identifier
shape: spherecap
# tile dimensions
tileHeight: 0.5
tileWidth: 0.5
# Sphere dimensions
radius: 5
# Max angle in radians
# will be 30 degrees either side of the azimuth
# in this example, and 30 degrees either side of
# the inclination (theta).
thetaMaxAngle: 0.5235987755982988
azimuthMaxAngle: 0.5235987755982988
# pixel change per tile
dx: 500
dy: 500
```

Run the following to generate the spherecap files.

```cmd
./generator --conf ./examples/SphereCap.yaml --outputFile ./examples/spherecap
```

The generated files will be in `./examples`
as `./examples/spherecap.obj` and `./examples/spherecap.json`.
Plug the obj into an obj visualiser and see how it looks.
Then try using  the TSIG with openTSG to generate a
pattern of your choosing.

Feel free to change any of the values in the file
and run it again, change the angles, try making
a wide view spherecap screen.

## Golden ratios

Any numbers that seem to work really well.
e.g. Dx* tile width / radius must = 5
